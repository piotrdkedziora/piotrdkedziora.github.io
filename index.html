              I am a young professional who seeks for new challenges and
opportunities. What I like the most in engineering is to learn
new things in order to resolve complex problems and then
deliver the best possible solutions. I have a strong technical
background but thanks to my studies abroad and volunteering
I achieved good communication and adaptation skills which, in
my opinion, are crucial nowadays.

developing and designing new workstations for assembling and production lines,
</li>
<li>
preparing both 3D models and technical documentation to prepare prototypes, performing tests and validating the solutions,
</li>
<li>
finding new suppliers for on-going and future projects.
</li>
<br>For Design Department I took care of:<br><br>
<li>
3D modelling and preparation of technical documentation of train seats components, 
</li>
<li>
applying corrections to previous projects according to clients feedback and introducing it to our production.

                  Double degree program in the field of mechanical engineering lectured in French at Grande École d'Ingénieurs in France. Just after starting my Bachelor studies I heard about the double degree program at the French Grande École. I started learning French and after 1.5 year I passed language certificate test and after an interview I was accepted to participate in this program. In total I spent 2 years in France and 4 years in Poland and I fulfilled all necessary conditions to obtain a degree at both universities. The main courses were devoted to manufacturing, strength of materials, material science, energetics, fluid mechanics, mathematics, thermodynamics and designing.  The thing I liked the most throughout these 2 years spent in France was the practical aspect of our studies. I could use lathe and milling machine to produce the parts I previously designed myself, which was a great experience and developed me as an engineer.

        Topic: Design of train seat components reinforced with a fiber of the natural origin<br><br></b></i>
      </p>
    
      <p align="justify">
        During my engineering studies, I familiarized myself with the topic of fiber-reinforced composites, which often combine characteristics unattainable for conventional materials, such as high mechanical strength and low weight. One of the main issues with currently used composites, including those reinforced with glass fibers, is the problem with their recycling. To solve this problem, many scientists propose the use of biomaterials that can be recycled more easily. <br><br>

The aim of my master's thesis was to produce, examine, and simulate the use of a composite reinforced with natural fibers in the structure of a public transportation seat, which is currently made of a glass fiber composite. In the first phase of the project, I identified two fibers with the greatest potential in terms of mechanical and economic aspects: jute and flax fabrics. Subsequently, I created samples in various configurations (different thicknesses and types of fabrics) for three categories of tested materials: glass fiber composites, natural fiber composites, and hybrid composites combining glass and natural fibers. Based on the obtained results, I estimated the missing material data necessary for conducting numerical simulations and simulated the utilization of such a material in the seat structure.<br><br>

</div>
<br>Through the use of an optimization algorithm, I managed to obtain a material configuration that is stronger than the currently employed glass fiber-reinforced composite, which is difficult to recycle. In conclusion, the findings of my research suggest that it is feasible to replace the current solution with a biocomposite that can achieve excellent strength values. Some potential issues I observed included reduced structural stiffness and inferior non-structural properties such as flammability; however, modifying the production process may contribute to resolving these problems. The results I obtained reaffirm my conviction that it is worthwhile to explore alternative, climate-friendly solutions in all aspects of life.<br><br>

<h3><br><br>Power transformers designs</h3>
<div data-aos="fade-up">
<p align="justify">
  <br>For the past 2.5 years, I have been working at Hitachi Energy (former ABB), where I design mechanical components for small and medium power transformers. My designs are produced and assembled at the factory in Finland. Despite significant automation and standardization of design process, the transformers we work on are unique, meaning that they are produced in small quantities, making each project different. Due to confidentiality clauses, I cannot share photos of the projects I have worked on, but I hope that a detailed description of my responsibilities, along with publicly available press materials attached below, will help readers understand what my tasks are related to.<br><br>

  During the first year of my work, I was designing the Active Part of the transformer, which include the core and its mounting. My job involved preparing 3D models along with production documentation and uploading it into the production software. As the active part can be considered as the heart of the transformer, it is crucial to ensure its compatibility with other components such as the tank and cover,  enough space for windings and the structure that connects winding exits with bushings (referred to as Cleats & Leads in transformer jargon) must also be provided. Throughout that year, I prepared approximately 15 active parts, with the most interesting projects being those used in transformers installed on the seabed and offshore wind turbines. Due to unusual loads, these projects required the preparation of several prototypes, analyses, and non-standard designs.<br><br>

<div data-aos="fade-up">
  <p align="justify">
    <br>After a year, I was promoted to the position of an external parts designer for transformers. Since then, I have been responsible for designing tanks, covers, conservators, cooling systems, and airboxes. During my work, I closely collaborate with the lead designer who communicates with the client. My design must ensure the installability of all the accessories used in power transformers, such as safety valves, oil level indicators, bushings, radiators, magnetic shunts, and many others. Additionally, I have to provide appropriate electrical clearances for energized components, take care of grounding all of the parts where eddy currents can be expected, and select materials with the appropriate properties. As our transformers are oil-filled, I must ensure the overall sealing of the construction (selecting gaskets or appropriate non-destructive testing methods for welds). In the case of any type of brackets or supports, I need to ensure sufficient mechanical strength, for which I rely on numerical simulations. At the end of the project, I send the finished 3D model along with assembly and welding documentation for the entire structure to the factory in Finland.<br><br>
